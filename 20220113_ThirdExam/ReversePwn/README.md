# Challenge Session 3 – Exercises Instruction

The Exercises will be uploaded on Moodle.

In this third challenge, you are asked to solve 3 exercises in the Reverse and Pwn Area:

1. GameOfThrones (PWN) – 10 Points
1. CrossTheBridge (REV) – 11 Points
1. CourseEvaluation (PWN) – 11 Points

For a total of 32 Points.

For each exercise, we supply two additional hints (available on Moodle), that can help you if you need:

1. The source code **(will automatically remove 3 points)**
1. An insight on how to solve the challenge **(will automatically remove 2 points)**

You can open the same hint all the times you want.

To solve an exercise, you need to find a flag in the specific format `SPRITZ{...}`, and send it to us along a description of what you did to find it (write-up), the eventual code you wrote, and the patched binary if you patched it.

**The write-up must be accurate and include details (e.g., addresses for breakpoints, patching) to demonstrate that you understood the challenge and solved it accordingly. Just reporting the flag is not enough! Even if you did not fully complete the challenge, please write what you understood and what was your idea to solve it, you could still gain some points!**

To submit your answer, put all the files you used (starting binaries, python code, patched binaries, ...), the flags, and the write-ups, in a zip folder called SOLUTIONS and upload it on moodle.

**THE SUBMISSION OF ANY FILE ON MOODLE WILL AUTOMATICALLY ERASE YOUR PREVIOUS SCORE.**

**You have time until 18:15.**

## NOTES

1. read the instructions of every exercise CAREFULLY. Patching a binary or a part of it that was forbidden will not give you any point!
1. The exercises order doesn’t matter, you can start from whatever you think is the best.
1. If you are stuck, use a hint or move to the next exercise. If you think there is an error in the binary, please contact us!
1. Please submit everything you did, even if you did not fully solved the exercises. You can still gain some precious points.
1. Do not get distracted by useless functions that print decorations.
