## Notes
* the provided 7z file (`handout_slashslash.7z`) won't be uploaded here because it'll just bloat git objs, instead it has been extracted
* `app/env/` won't be uploaded for the same reason, it's useless for the challenge anyways

## Solution
* you don't have to run the app in order to get the flag
* there isn't a clear flag here but one of the teaching assistants mentioned that it's just the flask secret

## ""Flag""
